Aggressive config stuff for the adventurous user (based on`...`)

Contents
--------

* ./.sh/cd-auto-ls - Runs `ls` every time you cd.
* ./.Xmodmap - Gives you `Hyper_L` instead of `Caps_Lock`, plus `Multi_key`
* coffee-1337.vim - Auto-write `.js` from `.cs`
* ctrlp-1337.vim - Pull in the *excellent*
  [CtrlP.vim](http://kien.github.com/ctrlp.vim/)
* delimitmate-addon.vim - Raimondi's awesome thing so you you don't have to
  type matching delimiters.
* xmonad.hs - Xmonad is the best window manager out there. This makes use of
  `Hyper_L` and adds a few layouts.
* .zsh/rc/autojump - Adds the 'j' command, if you've installed autojump.
