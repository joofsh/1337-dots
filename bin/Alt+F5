## Script bound to Alt+F5 in XMonad

# (A script I recorded after hitting F1 then mod-2 then F5)
# (Expects having a vim bind F1 to :w<cr> and a web browser on workspace 2.)

# Note that I'm using zsh -c instead of direct invocation because XMonad
# doesn't have my $PATH right. I could potentially fix this in my init
# scripts.
